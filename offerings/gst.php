<h3>GST Solution</h3>
<p>
	The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regimen likely to be effective

from 1 st July 2017 promises to bring a single unified tax regime for

India, which will consolidate many different taxes into a single tax

regime.</p><p>

Some of the taxes to be subsumed into GST will be
<ul>

	<li> VAT</li>

	<li> Service Tax</li>

	<li> Excise</li>

	<li> Entertainment Tax</li>

	<li> Entry Tax</li>
</ul>

</p><p>

A single tax regime will bring predictability and lower operating

costs for businesses because the GST will reduce the overall tax

burden by reducing the impacts of cascading taxes and allow the

cross-utilization of tax credits across the supply chain.

IT teams will be wondering what they will need to be doing from a

planning and implementation stage to update and review ERP

systems to be ready for the GST. Now these changes could be as

simple as updating the version but in most cases it is not so

simple. A change in an ERP requires a coordinated effort between

tax, IT and other departments to ensure success.

Generally speaking, the GST will require businesses to revisit the

following areas in their ERP:
<ul>
	<li> Procurement or Materials Modules</li>

	<li> Sales or Supply Chain Modules</li>

	<li> Financial Management Modules</li>
</ul>
</p><p>

Each of these modules are impacted with the change to GST.

One of the challenges with the GST, will be a widening of the

taxable basis because now the provision of almost any type of

good or services is taxable. GST transitions the taxable event from

sales, distribution, manufacture, and provision to simply the event

of a supply.
</p><p>

Any change in rates is still a major ERP event because you have

to create new tax codes, conditions and update information about

products and materials.
</p><p>

Businesses which used to only be involved in the provision of

certain types of supplies will make sure all their ERP processes

are considering tax. It is important to spend time reviewing your

existing process or business flows to understand where tax

consequences could. This change has impacts on how orders are

taken, goods are received, materials and reporting for internal

purposes and compliance reporting.
</p><p>

Specifically, for tax compliance, ERPs should produce data which

can be used to create the appropriate entries into the GSTN for

outward and inward transactions and make sure valid tax invoices

can be created. The requirement to upload data to the GSTN

pushes the requirement to create accurate tax specific data up the

chain to the ERP rather than trying to fill in the data at a later point

for compliance. ERPs need to capture the relevant data or can fill

in missing data as the process runs through before the compliance

begins. If a business attempts to create the data at the time of

compliance this can lead to delays and mismatches with invoices

which are already created.
</p><p>

All components of the ERP require maintenance and so as the

GST stabilizes there will be an increased strain on Tax and IT

teams to continuously update, test and re-visit scenarios as the

business processes evolve after the GST. Any ERP migration

strategy should include an increase amount of time for

maintenance and re-evaluation until at least 18 months after the

operation of the GST.
