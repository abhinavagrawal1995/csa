		<h3>What are Oracle Business Accelerators</h3>
		<p>
		Oracle Business Accelerators (OBA) provide an on-line, automated set-up tool that supports the rapid implementation of Oracle E-Business Suite Applications. 

		<b>In summary, the OBA approach:</b>
		<ul>
			 <li>Provides automatic application configuration.</li>

			 <li>Utilises business related questionnaires.</li>

			 <li>Delivers an Oracle E-Business Suite Application environment, quickly and effectively.</li>

			 <li>Is based on industry standards and needs.</li>

			 <li>Configures end-to-end business process flows.</li>

			 <li>Reduces the time, cost, and complexity of the overall implementation:</li>

			 <li>Utilises business related questionnaires.</li>

			 <li>by building in industry best practices</li>

			 <li>and saving 30% of implementation costs.</li>
